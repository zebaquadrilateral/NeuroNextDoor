The human brain, in all its complexity, shows remarkable structural similarities between sexes, but there have also been claims of significant differences. From global brain size to cortical thickness and functional lateralization, scientific research has sought to determine whether these anatomical disparities can truly be attributed to sexual dimorphism. Let’s explore some of the most debated aspects of the male and female brain.

Global Brain Size and Weight
On average, male brains are larger than female brains, but this difference is not as straightforward as it seems. Males tend to have brains that are roughly 10% heavier than females, even after adjusting for body weight. When looking at brain weight relative to body mass, newborn boys' brains are about 4% heavier, but this gap widens in adulthood to 18% more weight in males. However, when adjusting for body height—since taller individuals generally have larger brains—the difference in brain size narrows significantly, with the effect size decreasing from a Cohen’s d of 1.4 (large) to 0.4 (small). So, while males generally have larger brains, this difference is not always meaningful when adjusted for body size and other factors.

Myelination: Is the Male Brain More Efficient?
Research has also suggested that myelination, the process of coating nerve fibers with a fatty substance to enhance signal transmission, may be more pronounced in males by the time they reach age 20. This could imply that, in general, male brains develop more efficient communication networks between neurons. However, whether this confers cognitive advantages or affects brain function in significant ways remains a topic of ongoing investigation.

The Size of the Corpus Callosum: Is It Larger in Females?
One of the earliest claims of sex differences in the brain was the suggestion that females have a larger corpus callosum—the bundle of nerve fibers connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain. This notion was first proposed by DeLacoste-Utamsing and Holloway in 1982, published in Science. However, a more recent review by Eliot et al. (2021), which analyzed six large studies, found that five of these studies reported no significant sex difference in the corpus callosum's area or volume. So, despite the early claims, the jury is still out on whether females truly have a larger corpus callosum than males.

Cortical Thickness: A Gender Divide?
The cortical thickness of the brain has been another area of debate. A meta-analysis by Eliot et al. (2021) reviewed 21 widely cited MRI studies and found that the evidence for sexual dimorphism in cortical thickness is far from clear. Of the studies reviewed, 14 found no significant sex differences, while 12 reported that females have greater cortical thickness in certain areas. Interestingly, four studies, including one of the largest with 94 brains, found that males actually had thicker cortices in certain regions. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of brain structure and the need for more nuanced research into these differences.

Lateralization of Language: Are Males More Lateralized?
Another popular belief is that males exhibit greater lateralization for language processing, meaning that language functions are more likely to be localized to one hemisphere in men than in women. However, a meta-analysis conducted by Sommer et al. (2008), which reviewed 26 studies, found no significant difference in lateralized activity during language processing between the sexes (effect size d = 0.01). Additionally, a resting-state functional connectivity study by Nielsen et al. (2013) with over 1,000 young adults found no significant sex differences in functional connectivity patterns during language tasks. These studies suggest that, in terms of brain organization for language, there may be more similarities than differences between the sexes.

Conclusion: The Bottom Line on Sexual Dimorphism in the Brain
While it is tempting to focus on the anatomical differences between male and female brains, the scientific evidence suggests that these differences, when they do exist, are often subtle and influenced by various factors such as body size, age, and developmental stage. In fact, many studies have failed to replicate early claims of sexual dimorphism in key brain areas like the corpus callosum or lateralization for language. The male brain may be larger and more myelinated, but these differences do not necessarily imply significant functional disparities. Rather than focusing on simplistic narratives of male and female brains, ongoing research is showing us a much more complex, nuanced picture of brain structure and function across sexes.
