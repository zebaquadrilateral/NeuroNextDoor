    <h1>Sexual Dimorphism in the Human Brain</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <section>
        <p>The human brain, in all its complexity, shows remarkable structural similarities between sexes, but there have also been claims of significant differences. From global brain size to cortical thickness and functional lateralization, scientific research has sought to determine whether these anatomical disparities can truly be attributed to sexual dimorphism. Let’s explore some of the most debated aspects of the male and female brain.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Global Brain Size and Weight</h2>
        <p>On average, male brains are larger than female brains, but this difference is not as straightforward as it seems. Males tend to have brains that are roughly 10% heavier than females, even after adjusting for body weight. When adjusting for body height—since taller individuals generally have larger brains—the difference in brain size narrows significantly, with the effect size decreasing from a Cohen’s d of 1.4 (large) to 0.4 (small).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Myelination: Is the Male Brain More Efficient?</h2>
        <p>Research has also suggested that myelination may be more pronounced in males by age 20, which could imply more efficient communication networks between neurons. However, whether this confers cognitive advantages remains a topic of ongoing investigation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Size of the Corpus Callosum: Is It Larger in Females?</h2>
        <p>Early claims suggested females have a larger corpus callosum, but recent studies show mixed results, with many finding no significant sex difference in the corpus callosum's area or volume.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Cortical Thickness: A Gender Divide?</h2>
        <p>Conflicting results have been reported in studies on cortical thickness. Some report no significant sex differences, while others find variations, indicating the need for further research to clarify these observations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Lateralization of Language: Are Males More Lateralized?</h2>
        <p>The belief that males exhibit greater lateralization for language processing is common, but studies have found no significant differences in lateralization patterns between sexes during language tasks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion: The Bottom Line on Sexual Dimorphism in the Brain</h2>
        <p>While some anatomical differences exist between male and female brains, they are often subtle and influenced by factors like body size and age. Rather than focusing on simplistic narratives, research continues to reveal a complex, nuanced picture of brain structure and function across sexes.</p>
